This solution works for Windows 2008/2012/2016 also 

After you restore active director, domain controller successfully, you cannot open user and group ( dsa.msc) and the below picture shows up.

"Naming information cannot be located because: The specified domain either does not exits or could not be contacted"
So you can easily fix that by doing following tasks.

1. Point DNS to AD itself.
2. Go to Registry editor and open the key SysvolReady at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters


The value of the key is 0 change it to 1. If the value is 1 change it to 0 and ‘Accept’, again change to 1 and accept. Exit registry editor.

Great !!! Worked like a charm.
