<p>This solution works for Windows 2008/2012/2016 also </p>

<p>After you restore active director, domain controller successfully, you cannot open user and group ( dsa.msc) and the below picture shows up.</p>

<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/X0wxNBAcfuvMwdwba0rylfMcaegDqb4sCZRxtITXJ1BMjyR4KOlhkMI-8FYeA96ZwBzNN-DZxP0dPpe9m3TKB8V0gwUUq9wlwrUlKBjM0Q0=s0-d" alt="" width="468" height="204" /></p>
<p>"Naming information cannot be located because: The specified domain either does not exits or could not be contacted"
So you can easily fix that by doing following tasks.</p>

<p>1. Point DNS to AD itself.</p>
<p>2. Go to Registry editor and open the key SysvolReady at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters</p>


<p>The value of the key is 0 change it to 1. If the value is 1 change it to 0 and ‘Accept’, again change to 1 and accept. Exit registry editor.</p>

<p>Great !!! Worked like a charm.</p>
