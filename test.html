<p>President Donald Trump has for the first time said he is prepared to be questioned under oath as part of an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election.</p>

<p>He said he was "looking forward" to it, subject to the advice of his lawyers.</p>

<p>Investigators are assessing if the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election in his favour - a claim denied by Mr Trump and Russia.</p>

<p>Investigators will also determine if Mr Trump obstructed the inquiry.</p>

<p>The US intelligence community has already concluded that Moscow tried to sway the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump.</p>
